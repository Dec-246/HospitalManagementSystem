# HospitalManagementSystem

What is this?

This is my project for SEM2 of my first year of university. My project is to create a hospital management system for a made up hospital. 



What does this involve?

This involves allowing the user to input information into my website and storing/ managing this data into the tables of a database. To Do this, I will be using multiple coding languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript.

For this project I will be using:

• HTML for the structure and content.
• PHP for server side communication.
• CSS for styling of Web pages.
• JavaScript for user interactivity.



What is the functionality?

Moreover, my website will manage data in relation to the staff and patients of my system, such as: names, emails, addresses, job roles, log-in details for accounts and more.



Why am I doing this?

I am doing this as a project to test my abilities and knowledge when it comes to databases and system management. Adding to this; this project will allow me to improve and widen my knowledge on this subject, therefore, allowing me to get better at dealing with php and how it is used in order to communicate with databases. 



What will be the benefits of this project?

As well as this, I have learnt throughout this project how (php) code is utilised in order to deal/ manage the users' input within a website and store this input within a table. 

within this learning curve, you can see within my project how I have also learnt how to display the users input from the database table, back onto the website. Therefore, this means that not only have I learnt how a user inputs into a database through my website, yet also how I can grab this data and display/ relay this information back to the user.
